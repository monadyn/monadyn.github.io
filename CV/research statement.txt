Distributed System Security: Large scale systems typically adopt distributed architecture, such as n-tier systems for Web applications. Due to complex dependency among the distribued nodes, there exists potential performance issue enigmas with hard traceability. We dig into those performance vulnerabilities (VSI-DDoS Attacks and Tail Attacks) to motivate Web services of fast responsiveness.

Security in Cloud Computing: Cloud Elasticity (e.g., Amazon EC2) provides opportunity of auto-scaling computing resources for dynamical user requirements. However, performance interferrence due to resource contentions among co-located VMs block the promotion of Cloud computing. We investigate those performance vulnerabilities inside the cloud to protect cloud services of fast responsiveness.

Virtual Cluster Management: With the wide adoptation of Cloud Computing for today's enterprise and research institution, the end-users expect the out-of-box applications. SIMULOCEAN is a web-based computing platform for scienti?c applications on Container technology, such as Docker, Singunarity. Those contained applications can run in multi-cloud environments (PEARC'17, Gateways'16), such as Private Cloud, Publid Cloud Amazon ECS, HPC Cloud XSEDE.
